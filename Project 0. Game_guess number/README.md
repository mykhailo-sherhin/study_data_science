### Project description
Guess specified by computer number per minimum attempts

### What case are we solving?
It is necessary to write program which guesses number per minimum number of attempts

**Competition conditions**
- Computer specifies integer number from 1 to 100 and we should guess it. Under "guess" we understand "write program that will guess number"
- Algorithm considers information about if random number is less or larger then our number

**Quality metrics**
Results are evaluated by average number of attempts per 1000 tries

**What we practise**
We practise writing good code in Python
